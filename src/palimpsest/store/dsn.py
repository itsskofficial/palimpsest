"""Turning what Supabase gives you into a connection that actually works.

Supabase hands you three different connection strings and the difference between them is
not cosmetic:

| what the dashboard calls it | port | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| Direct connection | 5432 | a real Postgres session. IPv6-only on the free tier. |
| Session pooler | 5432 | pgBouncer in *session* mode. Behaves like Postgres. IPv4. |
| Transaction pooler | 6543 | pgBouncer in *transaction* mode. **Different semantics.** |

Transaction mode hands your connection back to the pool after every statement, so
anything that lives in a session is gone: server-side prepared statements, `SET` outside
a transaction, `LISTEN`, temporary tables, and advisory locks. Code written against a
direct connection appears to work, then fails under concurrency with
`prepared statement "S_1" already exists` — a message that tells you nothing about the
cause.

So this module does three things:

1. **Detects which one you handed it** and reports it, rather than discovering it at
   the first concurrent request.
2. **Applies the constraints**: no server-side prepared statements on a pooler, and
   `sslmode=require` on any hosted Postgres, because Supabase requires TLS and psycopg2
   defaults to `prefer` — which silently accepts an unencrypted connection if the server
   allows one.
3. **Recommends the right URL for the job.** For a long-lived ECS task the transaction
   pooler is right. For running migrations it is wrong: `CREATE TABLE` inside an
   implicit transaction across a pooler is fine, but `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` and
   anything session-scoped is not.
